"""
The x-bar and R-chart are control charts used to monitor the mean and variation of a
process based on samples taken in a given time.

X-bar chart: The mean or average change in process over time from subgroup values.
The control limits on the X-Bar brings the sampleâ€™s mean and center into consideration.

R-chart: The range of the process over the time from subgroups values.
This monitors the spread of the process over the time.
