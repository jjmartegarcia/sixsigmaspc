"""
An Individual moving range (I-MR) chart is used when data is continuous and not collected in subgroups.
An I-MR chart provides process variation over time in graphical method.
I-MR chart is basically two separate charts â€“ Individuals (I) chart and Moving Range (MR) chart, the combination of two charts provides the complete picture of process behavior.

I-Chart: Individual chart displays the individual data points and monitors mean and shifts in
the process when the data points collected at regular intervals of time. This chart will help to
identify the common and assignable causes in the process, if any.

MR Chart: While Individual chart monitors the process mean, the Moving Range chart monitors the
process variation when the data points collected at regular intervals of time. In other words the
moving range chart tracks the absolute difference of each measurement to its previous measurement.
