"""
X Bar S charts are control charts to examine the process mean and standard deviation over the time.

X-bar chart: The mean or average change in process over time from subgroup values.
The control limits on the X-Bar brings the sampleâ€™s mean and center into consideration.

S-chart: The standard deviation of the process over the time from subgroups values.
This monitors the process standard deviation (as approximated by the sample moving range).
